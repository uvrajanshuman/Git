# Git Workflow

- The Git repository is actually a hidden sub-directory (.git folder) in the project directory.
- Whenever the project reaches a stage that we want to record, we commit those changes to the repository. It is like taking snapshot of the project.
- Git has an intermediate area called staging area or index.
- When we are done making changes in our project directory, we add the files to the staging area, review our changes and commit.
- The staging area allows to review the work before taking the snapshot.
- If some of the changes that should not be part of the next snapshot and got added to staging area, they can be simply unstaged (removed from staging area).
- Once a commit is made, the staging area has the same content (version of project) as the repository. Staging area does not become empty on commit.
- So, if some files are changed in working directory, they again should be staged before committing.

- **Commit:** Each commit contains
    1. ID: unique identifier generated by git.
    2. Message
    3. Date & Time
    4. Author
    5. Snapshot (complete snapshot of the project)
  
So, Git stores the complete snapshot of the project for each commit, unlike other version control systems which store only the changes.
So, Git can quickly restore the project to previous versions without having to compute the changes.<br>
Even though complete snapshot is captured. Git stores data quite efficiently by compressing the data and ignoring the duplicate content.
