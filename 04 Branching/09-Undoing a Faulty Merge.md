# Undoing a Faulty Merge

In case we need to undo a merge we have two options:

1. Remove the merge commit, as if it was never there <br>
(This involves re-writing the history so, this should be done oly when the repository is not shared with others)
2. Revert the merge commit

## 1. Remove the last merge commit
